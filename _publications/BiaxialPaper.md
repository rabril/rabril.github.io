title: "Non-Abelian defect junctions in chiral nematic systems with biaxial symmetry"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/BiaxialPaper
excerpt: 'We study the topologically stable structures in chiral nematic systems which exhibit biaxial behavior. Mapping onto a biaxial representation of the chiral nematic system allows one to predict and explain the stable structures that arise when defects entangle and interact. Because of such biaxiality, the system is imbued with a set topological defect lines that inherit the algebraic properties of the quaternions from their non-Abelian fundamental group. This in turn provides topological stability to linked and braided structures formed out of these topological line defects. We give an overview of the complex structures that can be formed from linking non-Abelian defect lines and provide a framework in which they can be described mathematically as a colored braid theory. Additionally, we provide examples of experimental realizations of simple tangled structures in chiral liquid crystal systems and provide examples of larger structures that may be formed with such knotted structures.'
